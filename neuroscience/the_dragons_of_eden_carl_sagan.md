The Dragons of Eden - Carl Sagan 

**Pros:** Very broad overview of brain topics. Clear reasoning, great history. Awesome for looking at all sort of different topics and approaches to the work. Carl loves science, fun to read in his voice. 

**Cons:** Sometimes feels like the line isn't drawn between science and speculation - not a huge deal, but hurts trust in the book. 

**Rate:** 7/10 good introduction to brain science (I think - may revisit)



0 - Introduction

- Humans have extremely plastic (impressionable) minds, at the cost of long childhoods
- we've also nailed storing information outside of our bodies
- "Biology is more like history than it is like physics"
- "Those at too great a distance mistake ignorance for perspective" nice
- no interest in mind-body dualism; treat flesh as a single system

1 - The Cosmic Calendar 

- This is a classic carl sagan bit - the point is that the universe is old and most stuff is new

2 - Genes and Brains

- Evolution tends to create more complex organisms, but not always (we still have algae)
- A species is basically the set of organisms that can reproduce competent offspring (terms and conditions apply)
- Measuring complexity
  - the range of behaviors that an organism can exhibit 
  - bits in the genome
- Mutation is often harmful - replication is best done precisely. Humans have a very long genome, which leaves the genome vulnerable to a higher chance of random harmful change.
  - There is likely an upper limit to how much information can be encoded in the genome before it's too hard to maintain 
  - Our large, fragile genomes are accommodated for by our large brains
- Storing things in brains
  - It's hard to tell how complex brain functions are - producing a behavior might be simple, but the process for arriving at it is hard to observe 
    - Consider how the best ideas seem simple in hindsight
  - Brains are redundant - injury or tissue removal does not destroy performance
- Chemistry
  - For every neuron, there's roughly 10 glial cells (structural)
  - Average neuron has 1,000-10,000 connections to adjacent neurons (synapses)
  - Being exposed to new things - having to learn - has shown to make the brain physically larger
  - Brains have come to dominate over genes as the best place to store information

3 - The Brain and the Chariot

- Brains grow in layers - the oldest and simplest animals have small brain stems, while more complex creatures add additional sections on top of the same base. Helps explain why "primal" actions are consistent even in more intelligent animals, such as people
- The most ancient part of the brain is in the spinal cord, the medulla and pons, which comprise the hindbrain and midbrain. This is basically enough brain to keep the body functioning and reproduce, but not much more. 
  - The minimum viable brain for simple animals. Also sometimes called the "reptile brain", or R-complex. 
  - Sexual and social instinct is stored here - aggression, territoriality, social hierarchies. 
- Next layer of brain is the Limbic system. We share this with other mammals, but generally not with reptiles, fish, or amphibians. 
  - Emotion is generated here
  - Amygdala is here - a big part of aggression and fear when stimulated
  - Special attention and care for offspring starts here, with some exceptions
  - Olfactory cortex is the oldest part of the limbic system, which processes smells. Often extremely specialized - for many simple animals, only pheromones are recognized 
  - Hippocampus is here, which holds memories 
- The Neocortex - the latest layer of the brain. Dolphins and whales have these. 
  - Controls the ability to predict the future, as well as our ability to project ourselves into that future
  - Temporal lobe: reading, writing
  - Parietal lobe: symbolic language - damage here causes the biggest hit to observable intelligence  
- Fetuses develop the brain from the inside out
- Yet another disclaimer that it's all more complicated than this is making it sound
  - It's ok carl, we know you're not a neurochemist

4 - Eden as a Metaphor: The Evolution of Man

- Consider surface area to mass ratio of most animals: for small creatures, it's high enough that they effectively can't be injured from falling; they reach terminal velocity quickly enough that they can take the fall. Larger animals don't have this ability, which is part of why motor coordination and vision have been selected for in primates 
- Unfortunately, humans have the most painful childbirth process out of nearly any species 
- Lots of stories about how nearly all social norms "evolved", literally and figuratively, from simpler behaviors or primitive models of language. For example, before we could say "I am unarmed", we could show that we were not holding weapons in our active hands - hence the handshake.

5 - The Abstraction of Beasts

- Stories from experiments in teaching primates language (ASL)
  - Generally very able to learn from one another - examples of monkeys in zoos learning to unwrap candy thrown into their enclosures
  - Unfortunately, rather hard to study considering how much time it takes

6 - Tales of Dim Eden

- â€‹	Sleep
  - It must be extremely important - selective pressure should be high to evolve out of the need to sleep, as animals are vulnerable while sleeping
    - It could also be the opposite - nocturnal animals may have evolved sleep as a way to be still and quiet during predator's waking hours, while emerging to forage at night 
  - Predators seem to dream more than prey, which may be correlated to their higher average brain / body mass
- Dinosaurs had remarkably small brain mass to body mass ratios - average intelligence was somewhere around rabbits
  - Some theories: some of our oldest predators having evolved from massive reptiles could explain associations of snakes with evil?
    - I think this is just Carl postulating - interesting, but not really proven one way or the other. He likes to do this. 
- Dreams
  - Purpose not fully known, of course
  - cognitive function degrades faster than motor control on lack of sleep - correlation between thinking / cognition and sleep's regenerative function
  - Chunks of the neocortex are disabled during sleep - many are unable to read or do math while dreaming

7 - Lovers and Madmen

- Different organisms have developed different perceptive skills they are hyper-tuned for: such as bloodhounds for scent, and hawks for sight. 
  - It may not seem so, but people have similar skills, albeit in more specific instances - such as recognizing faces
    - While a face may be visually recognizable, it may not be describable well - this specificity of skill does not translate well 
- There are some surgeries for "splitting" the two hemispheres of the brain, and in such cases, there can be surprising effects in separation of abilities. For example, reading tactile letters of text with the hands (motor coordination, right brain) does not let a patient translate those characters into words (reading, left brain)
- There is (purely anecdotal) precedent of people experiencing a separation of portions of their brains into discrete egos, while dreaming or on marijuana/LSD. For example, "talking" to a being who helps scientists work through difficult problems
  - Freudian shit 

8 - The Future Evolution of the Brain

- It's a shame that so much of our culture seems to be governed by the R-brain - it's not as needed as it used to be. 
- Carl postulates that a handful of our most complicated moral issues, mostly relating to killing, could be examined or at least more precisely discussed if we had a consistent definition of intelligence
  - We have a fuzzy model now, sort of like how some animals are for eating and some are for pets - but it's obviously not a clear scale
- Brain-computer interfaces seem very cool to SF authors, but are often classified as a discrete jump from where we are now; this is not really the case. We interface with our brains with every action: every moment of life is a set of inputs to a brain, which shape the network and define outputs. 
  - We could chip people's brains, yes, but making sure elementary students eat three meals a day might be an even better solution for increasing brainpower
  - Focusing on tools again, written language is an excellent brain computer interface
  - Graphing programs and data visualization software are other examples of harnessing compute power to aid cognition
-  To the haters who say that computers may ruin our ability to think: carl cites Plato's *Phaedrus*, in that this same counterpoint was made against people learning to read and write; that it will dull their memories and cognition, being able to rely on text. LMAO 

9 - Knowldege Is Our Destiny: Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Intelligence

- Consciencness and intelligence are favored by natural selection; we may expect aliens to have evolved it, certainly if they're communicating with us
  - Species who struggle to manipulate or understand their environment die long before they can build radio transmitters
- the degree to which aliens may be different from us is wild
  - It's not a given that they'll be interested in spaceflight if they live on a particularly flat world 
  - they could be blind or deaf, in the same way that humans are missing some senses that other animals take for granted
