The Future of the Brain



- Preface
  - Computation will enable a new frontier of understanding the brain - it's a massive system, and prior science has never had the tools to look at it rigorously
- Building Atlases of the Brain (Mike Hawrylycz)
  - Brain maps have been analog until the last 20 years or so 
  - There's an ongoing problem of a "standard brain" - but that's hard to find for several reasons
  - Increased function may have more to do with the density of connections in the brain, rather than expansion of specialized regions
  - We largely don't have the tools to take good pictures or scans of the brain. And if we did have the scans, we wouldn't have the right algorithms to interpret the data. And if we had the algorithms, we wouldn't have the compute to run the algos over datasets as large as the ones that brain scans generate. This is hard. 
- Whole Brain Neuroimaging and Virtual Reality (Misha B. Ahrens)
  - The Sensorimotor loop: the OODA loop of the brain
  - It's hard to image a brain at rest, because its state is constantly changing as it interacts with the environment. To get a better scan, we may try to watch the brain as it responds to different stimuli. However, this causes the brain to move along with the rest of the organism, which makes the scan harder. The solution: virtual reality. 
    - You can't just paralyze the organism, or it's sensorimotor loop is interrupted. You have to allow it to believe it's interacting with the environment, and get the proper stimulus in response. 
    - Experiment: image a fly's brain, but glue it in place. Connect a directional fan to the fly's wings, and place it in a drum with an image of nature. When it tries to fly, blow air at the right vector and rotate the drum space so the fly thinks it's flying. 
  - Once again, we need more compute power
- Project Mindscope (Christof Koch)
  - The Neocortex - the interesting part of the brain that learns from life, as opposed to coming more so pre-filled with instinctual knowledge
  - TL;DR: Mindscope aims to image the brain of a mouse
  - On neuroscience research: since funding is competitive, and students must write first-author papers, researchers are "headed away from each other, in all possible directions, like the big bang"
    - We could get better science done if we worked together - physicists and astronomers have figured this out due to their need to build massive equipment (particle accelerators, telescopes) which let them get more done. Part of the Mindscope project is to spur that sort of collaboration.
- The Connectome as a DNA Sequencing Problem (Anthony Zador)
  - The Neural Networks in the brains of live organisms are far more complex than the ones that AI devs have created (who would have thought)
  - To design a NN that behaves like the brain, we COULD try to image the brain and copy that. But it may be easier to sequence a genome that contains the information which leads to the brain's creation, and feed that data to a construction mechanism and let the genes generate the brain, so we never have to quite understand it.
    - This exposes the problem of brain modeling to the wonderfully declining cost curves of genome sequencing, which brain imaging does not have
  - This obviously isn't an instant solution - loading genome data into a "brain printer" is still a hard problem - this is just one way to partially sidestep the hard problem of brain imaging
- Rosetta Brain (George Church) 
- Neurotechnology (Jon Donohugue)
  - The connections in the brain can seem recursive - some networks of neurons bunch together, and those bunches act as nodes in larger, more complex networks 
  - Difficulties in developing implants for brains:
    - Immune system rejection, as well as corrosion / degradation
    - Movement, heat, power
    - Hardware size and precision - "threads" are a good tool to use, so they can be pulled into place 
  - the immense amount of data that comes from recording neurons - ML needed to determine a) when a neuron is activated, how much, and b) what that means 
    - neuralink mfs - orders of magnitude more threads (IO) means better models for predicting meaning 
- An integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels (Neuralink)
  - Three important things we've built:
    - Ultra-fine polymer probes (threads) to be inserted into the brain
    - a neurosurgical robot
- The Miswired Brain, Genes, and Mental Illness (Kevin J. Mitchell)
  - Schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and developmental disorders are caused by some of the same genes - the same genes can cause different effects in different people
