<u>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</u> - By Klaus Schwab

**Pros**: Some good history, great value in listing economic externalities of macro technological trends

**Cons**: Clearly written by someone without technical skills, no specifics, little reasoning from first principles / heavy in analogy

**Rate**: 4/10, mostly common sense to a young tech bro 



- Introduction
  - The current era of innovation is the Fourth Industrial revolution
  - Here's 3 things that are unique about this one, compared to the last:
    - Velocity: exponential rather than linear pace
    - Breadth and Depth: combinations of technologies compound one another
    - Systems Impact: is changing countries, companies, industries and society as a whole
  - 3 goals of this book:
    - increase awareness of the 4th revolution, its comprehensiveness and pace
    - outline possible issues and fixes
    - inspire public-private cooperation
  - We do not have only the two options of accept or reject the future: we can, and must, shape it deliberately
- 1 - The Fourth Industrial Revolution
  - 1.1 - Historical Context (of industrial revolutions)
    - #1: agriculture and livestock (~10k years ago)
      - led to population growth, cities, animal labor 
    - #2: steam engine (1760-1840)
      - railroads, mechanical production over muscle
    - #3: computers (1960+)
      - Mainframes in the 60's, PCs 70's-80's, Internet 90's
    - #4: IOT & universal internet access
      - Two main concerns: One, that people don't understand it, and two, that people won't know why we're doing this (think silicon valley - great new tools, but dumbass startups using them for silly things)
  - 1.2 - Profound and Systematic change
    - "This time it's different" - it truly is
    - Returns to scale are staggering with technology companies - marginal costs approach zero with many markets
      - The wealth gap will continue to be a growing problem as a result of this 
- 2 - Drivers
  - 2.1 - Megatrends
    - autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, robotics, new materials
    - blockchainz, "uber models", platform models
    - Genomics - never sleep on a declining cost curve
  - 2.2 - Tipping Points
    - we do a bit here where members of the WEF and execs are surveyed for how close they think certain things are. These don't make sense together - many of these arbitrary goals are two or three separate ideas rolled into one. For example, "the first 3-D printed car is on the road" and "first transplant of a 3D printed liver", "the first AI machine is on a corporate board of directors"
- 3 - Impact 
  - 3.1 - Growth
    - Pessimist arguments:
      - GDP CAGR has not recovered from the financial crisis - "secular stagnation", low demand which can't be fixed with zero interest rates
      - Aging - birth rates below replacement levels are a problem
    - Optimism:
      - 4th revolution will include bringing in massive new demographics into the global economy, via things like global internet access
      - IOT type shit is great at incentivizing things which were once externalities - consider green energy (not to mention, again, cost curves)
    - Labor markets
      - The gender gap in the workforce will likey increase: male dominated (CS/engineering) fields will grow and automate jobs typically held by uneducated/unskilled workers
        - The jobs "pyramid" may hollow out in the center, as mid-level jobs drift upwards or downwards
      - winner-take-all dynamics may extend to not only companies and industries, but within and between countries as well
      - "the human cloud" - silly word for gig economy
        - more flexibility for workers, or a "race to the bottom digital sweatshop"  
  - 3.2 - Business
    - The lifecycle of businesses are shrinking - new companies are growing faster than established ones, time to join the S&P is decreasing
    - Data enhanced products: tesla's over the air updates raise the value of the asset after purchase
    - "Improving Asset productivity" - finally, a good term for the uber/airBnB thing
      - Historically, these models have been hard to maintain, because they require lots of data to price and monitor effectively - but sensors and networks are the perfect tool to automate that work
    - Hiring and retaining talent: employees who are more able to see their other possibilities will be less loyal to firms. Businesses must become less top-down in their structuring 
  - 3.3 - National and Global
    - Governments basically embody all the traits of the businesses that are being disrupted - large, slow to adapt, heavy on tradition and resistant to new structure
    - Cities are of great importance - they are where the innovation comes from
      - I personally doubt that this will cease to be true just because covid let us all zoom more often - reminds me of How Google Works's "create the primordial ooze"
    - Digital divide is also important to address - getting people online 
    - CYBERWARFARE and buzzword shit
      - A takeaway from this book: technology is something I work with and understand more than the average person - so books like this are not as useful to me 
  - 3.4 - Society
    - This section is a list of the top 100 things that are different now that we have cell phones, yada yada yada
- The Way Forward
  - completely meaningless fluff
