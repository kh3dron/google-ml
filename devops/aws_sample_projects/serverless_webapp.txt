## Build a Serverless Web Application

- Host a static site in S3:
    - Use AWS Code commit to create a repo, clone into it, then AWS Amplify to host that static HTML/CSS/JS content
    - git CLI words: {'git add .', 'git commit -m 'new shit'', 'git merge'}
- Manage users:
    - Create a signin portal with Cognito: sends email codes to new users as they sign up. Maintains user pool for applicaiton. password - Learn2Fly!
- Serverless Backend
    - Create a DynamoDB table
    - Create an IAM role for the Lambda function - give it the rights to put an item into a dynamoDB table. Specify this particular dynamoDB table via ARN in resource privs
    - Create Lambda function for handling requests - case sensitivity issue
- Create a new rest API
    - Create another user pool in cognito
    - Create a Cognito Pools Authorizor
    - Create a new resource, then method inside the API
    - Once you deploy the API, you get your invokeURL
    - Put that invokeURL into the site's config.js file and it'll all tie together nicely
- Delete everything
    - pretty simple
